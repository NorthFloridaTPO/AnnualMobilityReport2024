The data presented are an essential part of making evidence-based decisions for the investment in mobility in North Florida. The data presented focuses on Clay, Duval, Nassau and St. Johns counties for the years 2018-2022 and 2019-2023 when available. This report summarizes trends in the following topics:"

Growth in population places a higher demand for mobility. North Florida’s strong growth outpacing population gains statewide is anticipated to continue through 2024.\nThe population grew by 0.5% nationally from 2022 to 2023. North Florida grew by 2.7% outpacing the nation and Florida at 1.58%.\nThere is no benchmark for population growth. Increases impact the demand for mobility."

Medically Underserved Areas/Populations are areas or populations designated by the U.S. Department of Health Resources and Services Administration as having too few primary care providers, high infant mortality, high poverty or a high elderly population. Nearly 370,000 persons in North Florida live in medically underserved areas. There are no benchmarks for population in underserved areas. It is desirable to ensure the population is adequately served.\nAccessing affordable and nutritious food was a challenge for nearly 800,000 persons in North Florida in 2015 (the latest date statistics are available). The US Economic Research Service of the Department of Agriculture identifies populations whose food security is at risk if they live in low-income areas and do not have a grocery store within 1 mile in an urban area and 10 miles in a rural area. There are no benchmarks for population living with food uncertainty. It is desirable to ensure the population is adequately served.\nThe following map highlights areas designated as medically underserved in 2019 and areas without reliable access to healthy foods in 2015 (the latest date statistics are available)."
